This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## ACHIEVEMENT
𝗦𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗣𝗛𝗣 𝘁𝗼 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁.𝗷𝘀: 𝗠𝘆 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆
I recently transitioned a legacy PHP app to Next.js, and it’s been a game-changer!
𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵?
PHP was great, but we needed something faster, more scalable, and modern. Next.js, with its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), fit the bill perfectly.
𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗱?
• Speed: Pages load faster with SSR and SSG.
• SEO: Better search engine rankings with server-side rendering.
• Scalability: Easily handled new features and traffic spikes.
• Developer Experience: Working with React and Next.js made development more enjoyable and efficient.
𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀:
• Refactoring: Moving from PHP’s sync model to JavaScript’s async approach was tricky.
• Learning Curve: Getting up to speed with React and Next.js took time but was worth it.
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲:
Our app is now faster, easier to maintain, and future-ready. Next.js has opened up new possibilities for us.
𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆: If you’re considering a move from PHP, I highly recommend exploring Next.js. The benefits in performance, SEO, and development experience are significant.
